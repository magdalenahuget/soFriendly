// Good or Awesome
// Ask a person in the predefined function if the person feels "good" or "awesome"

// Check the answer
// Check the answer of a person. If the answer is neither "good" nor "awesome", console log that you do not understand the answer - else repeat the answer on the console

// The age question
// Write a function that asks a person for his age and returns it. Check the age and make different console logs for the ages smaller equal 5, bigger 5 and smaller equal 20, bigger 20 and smaller equal 40, and bigger 40 - e.g. if age is bigger 40 you could log: "Soon you will be in pension - great!"

// Further conversation
// Think about a question you would ask in a small talk conversation and let your program ask this question. For this purpose declare a function with a nice name. Return the answer of the user and react to it in a proper way.
