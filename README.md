Tasks
Create a "+" function
Create a function addition which takes two parameters (numbers) and returns the sum of both

Create a "-" function
Create a function subtraction which takes two parameters (numbers) and returns the difference of both

Create a "*" function
Create a function multiplication which takes two parameters (numbers) and returns the product of both

Create a "/" function
Create a function division which takes two parameters (numbers) and returns the Quotient of both. Be aware that a division by zero should not be possible. If your function detects a divion by zero it should just return 0.

Create a "%" function
Create a function modulo which takes two parameters (numbers) and returns the result of their modulo equation.

Uncomment code
Uncomment implemented code after you have created your functions and check the results.

Hint
Modulo returns the rest of a division. 10%3 for example equals 1 since 10/3 = 3 and 1 is left.
